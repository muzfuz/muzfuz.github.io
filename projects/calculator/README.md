JS Calculator
=============

[Click to see it in action!](http://muzfuz.com/calculator/)

Basic calculator app, written in JavaScript, with a HTML / CSS UI.

The front end is entirely composed of `div` tags with various classes and ID's to style it.  The back end logic is fairly straightforward too.  

Features are not 100% complete, so you can't use parenthesis or input negative numbers.
