###[Play it Here!](http://muzfuz.com/snake)
Clone of the classic game of Snake.  Written in JavaScript, with a little bit of jQuery thrown in for good measure.

The bulk of the game's logic is written in [this](https://github.com/muzfuz/JS_Snake/blob/master/script/snake.js) file, called snake.js.

I wrote most of this program myself. I have attributed in the code where I did use bits of code from Stack Overflow etc.
